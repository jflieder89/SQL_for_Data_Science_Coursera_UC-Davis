Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

I used the coding form Select * From (table)
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

I used the coding form Select Count(distinct key) from table

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643 
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 8090 (used business_id)
vi. Checkin = 493 
vii. Photo = 6493 
viii. Tip = 3979 (used business_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:

No
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

Select *
From user
Where id is Null or name is Null 
or review_count is Null or yelping_since is Null
or useful is Null or funny is Null or cool is Null
or fans is Null or average_stars is Null 
or compliment_hot is Null or compliment_more is Null
or compliment_profile is Null or compliment_cute is Null
or compliment_list is Null or compliment_note is Null
or compliment_plain is Null or compliment_cool is Null
or compliment_funny is Null or compliment_writer is Null
or compliment_photos is Null
	
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

I used the code form Select Min(column), Max(column), AVG(column) From table

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg:  3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1.0	max:	5.0	avg:  3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg:  1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg:  24.2995

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

I chose restaurants in Phoenix. 
The restaurants in the 2-3 star range had either the broad hours of 5am - 11pm/12am or the assorted hours of 9am/11am - 2pm/12am. 
The restaurants in the 4-5 star range had either the short hours of 11am/1pm-4pm/6pm or the longer hours of 11am-10pm.
The hours were different between all of the restaurants, but there was no clear pattern or association between star range and hours.

Here's the code I used for this:

Select business.id, business.name, business.city, business.stars, hours.hours
From business
Inner Join hours 
ON hours.business_id = business.id
Where business.id in (Select category.business_id
    From category
    Where category = 'Restaurants')
And business.city = 'Phoenix'
--And business.stars between 2 and 3
And business.stars between 4 and 5


	ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

I again looked at restaurants in Phoenix.

The restaurants in the 2-3 star range had review counts of 8 and 60.
The restaurants in the 4-5 star range had review counts of 7, 188, and 431.
The higher rated restaurants had a higher review count in general than the lower rated restaurants.

Here's the code I used:

Select business.id, business.name, business.city, business.stars, business.review_count
From business
Where business.id in (Select category.business_id
    From category
    Where category = 'Restaurants')
And business.city = 'Phoenix'
--And business.stars between 2 and 3
And business.stars between 4 and 5 
         
         
	iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

I was able to infer that the better restaurants were generally reviewed more often. 
Therefore, perhaps the more popular restaurants received more customers overall, which lead to more reviews.
Also, perhaps their were more referrals from previous customers to later customers for the higher rated restaurants.

SQL code used for analysis:

Select business.id, business.name, business.city, business.stars, hours.hours
From business
Inner Join hours 
ON hours.business_id = business.id
Where business.id in (Select category.business_id
    From category
    Where category = 'Restaurants')
And business.city = 'Phoenix'
--And business.stars between 2 and 3
And business.stars between 4 and 5

Select business.id, business.name, business.city, business.stars, business.review_count
From business
Where business.id in (Select category.business_id
    From category
    Where category = 'Restaurants')
And business.city = 'Phoenix'
--And business.stars between 2 and 3
And business.stars between 4 and 5 
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

Open businesses tend to have more reviews.
         
         
ii. Difference 2:

After browsing a few cities, it appears that some neighborhoods have more open businesses than closed businesses.
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

Select *
From business
Where business.is_open = 1
--Where business.is_open = 0
--And city = 'Toronto'
Order by business.stars desc

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I will compare the stars and review counts for the highest starred businesses in Las Vegas and Phoenix. Perhaps there will be useful information to glean in this analysis.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I'll choose the customer dependent columns of the business table along with hours and category. This will hopefully tie the performance of the business (stars, reviews, etc.) based on some pattern/association of business characteristics.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

--------------------------------+--------------+-----------+-------+--------------+---------------------------------+--------------------+
| name                           | neighborhood | city      | stars | review_count | category                        | hours              |
